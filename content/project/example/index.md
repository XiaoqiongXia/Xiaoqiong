1. Used MGLTools and AutoDock-GPU to build a virtual screening process for molecular fragments on a Linux system and screen high-scored molecular fragments efficiently. 
2. Developed a fragment growth model using a diffusion algorithm to generate reasonable candidate molecules with high affinity to the target. 
3. Used the GROMACS tool to perform molecular dynamics simulation of the receptor-ligand complex.
