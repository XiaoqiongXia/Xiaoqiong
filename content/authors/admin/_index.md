Xiaoqiong Xia is a Ph.D. candidate at the Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, and expects to graduate in June 2024. Her Ph.D. advisor is Professor Lei Liu, who is a leading researcher in the field of bioinformatics. Her research interests focus on artificial intelligence for early-stage drug discovery. She worked on developing drug-target interaction, drug activity prediction, and molecular generation models by combining deep learning algorithms with computer-aid drug design tools. Her proposed methods facilitate drug discovery and repurposing.
